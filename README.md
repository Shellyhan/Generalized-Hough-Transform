# Generalized-Hough-Transform

## Method used:

Generalized Hough Transform is used to detect objects from the test images. Here are some detail steps:

1. The gray scale copy of image is obtained

2. Median filter is applied to smooth image

3. Sobel Edge Detector is used to find edges of image

4. Obtain the gradient orientation of both the template and image

5. R-table is obtain from the template, containing:

     a. Angles from edge point to the reference

     b. dx and dy values for each edge point wrt reference

     c. reference point is set as the middle point of the template

6. Apply rotation and scale operation is needed:

     a. For rotation with D degrees counter-clockwise:

       i. New dx = cos(D) * dx â€“ sin(D) * dy

       ii. New dy = sin(D) * dx + cos(D) * dy

     b. For scale with k factor:

       i. New dx = k* dx

       ii. New dy = k * dy


7. Accumulator matrix is generated by counting votes on each position

8. Potential maxima are identified as matches and highlighted
